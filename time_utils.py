"""Utilities for working with business hours.

The module previously exposed ``BUSINESS_START`` and ``BUSINESS_END`` as
mutable module-level globals.  Directly changing those values from other
modules made it easy to accidentally mutate them without a consistent API.

To centralize configuration, business hours are now stored in a small
``BusinessHoursConfig`` object.  Callers should use the provided setter and
getter helpers to adjust or read the configured hours.
